1. Why is it wrong to do try and except in the api calls?
  What if the api call fails? shouldnt we display that error?

2. I dont know how to debug django and react. 
  Please show me how you are doing this. 
  (i have a problem with register view- 
  validate password and user_role )

3. I should redo home page. getcountries
  it has an unknown problem that it just keep rendering 
  and never stops  
  and i should redo the edit buttons display because its not 
  the best way to check if a user is an admin everytime
  this component renders.
  so i should have a state? (redux) 

  another question related to this,
  how can i know what requests are being processed after some 
  component is mounted.. (hope i used the right words)

  well you can either use a breakpoint or console.log()   eifo sheho i wrote that i dont know how to debug
  well

4. Everytime i call an api endpoint, 
  i should call the variable i created on the api folder.
  cant remember how you did this.

5. navbar component - not that important but i would
  like to know what i did wrong with darkmode.

6. Passing a date to flight search component has a problem.

7. In api calls folder:  is there a point to use async and await ?

8. why for example in main page every time this component is mounted it sends 
  multiple requests?
  
9.Change files name to be first capital letter (index.js, http, etc.)

10. Change all api calls to be from the api folder and not manually written

11. After login theres a problem :
 Uncaught runtime errors:
  Ã—
